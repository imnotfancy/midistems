# MidiStems Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the MidiStems project, which aims to create a cross-platform application for audio stem separation and MIDI extraction.

## Week 1: Setup and Basic Infrastructure âœ…

- [x] Set up development environment
  - [x] Install Rust and Cargo
  - [x] Install Flutter
  - [x] Install necessary dependencies (libasound2-dev, etc.)
  - [x] Configure non-root user for Flutter (security best practice)
- [x] Create Rust library structure
  - [x] Set up cdylib configuration for FFI
  - [x] Create module structure (audio_io, dsp, midi)
  - [x] Implement basic FFI functions
- [x] Implement FFI bridge
  - [x] Create Dart FFI service
  - [x] Implement dynamic library loading
  - [x] Create test for FFI integration
  - [x] Implement simple audio test function
- [x] Create Flutter project structure
  - [x] Set up basic UI components
  - [x] Configure dependencies in pubspec.yaml
  - [x] Create audio processing screen with test functionality
