## Key Findings

1. **Strong Market Opportunity**: The AI music market is projected to reach $2.79 billion by 2030 (30.4% CAGR).

2. **Competitive Gap**: No major competitor offers seamless integration between stem separation and MIDI generation.

3. **Technical Feasibility**: A phased approach using Rust for audio processing with Flutter/Tauri for UI offers the best balance of performance and development efficiency.

4. **Target Market**: Semi-professional producers ($30-50/month tier) represent the primary target segment.

5. **Implementation Strategy**: A phased migration approach is recommended, starting with enhancing the current Flutter implementation with a Rust audio core.

## Implementation Plan

Based on these analyses, a detailed implementation plan has been created. See the [Implementation Plan](../../implementation_plan.md) in the root directory for the execution strategy.
