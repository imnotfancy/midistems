## Technical Implementation Details

### Rust Audio Core Architecture

The Rust audio core will be implemented as a standalone library that can be integrated with Flutter through FFI. The core architecture will include:

1. **Audio I/O Layer**
   - Cross-platform audio device access using `cpal`
   - File format support (WAV, MP3, FLAC) using `symphonia`
   - Real-time audio buffer management

2. **DSP Processing Pipeline**
   - Stem separation using Demucs algorithm (Rust port)
   - MIDI extraction using pitch detection algorithms
   - Real-time audio effects and processing

3. **FFI Interface Layer**
   - C-compatible API for Flutter integration
   - Serialization/deserialization of complex data types
   - Error handling and resource management

### Flutter Integration Strategy

The integration with Flutter will be implemented in phases:

1. **Phase 1: Basic Integration**
   - Simple FFI calls for audio file loading and playback
   - Synchronous processing for stem separation
   - Basic UI for controlling audio processing

2. **Phase 2: Advanced Integration**
   - Asynchronous processing with progress reporting
   - Real-time audio visualization
   - Complex data exchange (MIDI events, audio buffers)

3. **Phase 3: Full Integration**
   - Real-time audio processing with low latency
   - Seamless UI/UX for audio manipulation
   - Advanced features (time stretching, pitch shifting)

### Performance Benchmarking Framework

To ensure the new implementation meets performance targets, a comprehensive benchmarking framework will be developed:

1. **Audio Latency Testing**
   - Round-trip latency measurement
   - Buffer size optimization
   - Platform-specific performance profiling

2. **Processing Speed Testing**
   - Stem separation processing time
   - MIDI extraction accuracy and speed
   - Memory usage and CPU utilization

3. **Quality Assessment**
   - Objective metrics (SDR, SIR, SAR)
   - Subjective listening tests
   - Comparison with existing solutions

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to enhancing the MidiStems application, focusing on performance improvements through the Rust audio core integration with the existing Flutter application.
