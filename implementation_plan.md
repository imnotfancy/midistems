## Technical Implementation Details

### Rust Audio Core Architecture

The Rust audio core will be implemented as a standalone library that can be integrated with Flutter through FFI. The core architecture will include:

1. **Audio I/O Layer**
   - Cross-platform audio device access using `cpal`.
   - File format support (WAV, MP3, FLAC) using `symphonia`.
   - Utilize `hound` for dedicated WAV file encoding and decoding, complementing `symphonia`'s broader format support, especially for ensuring robustness with WAV files.
   - Incorporate `rubato` for high-quality asynchronous sample rate conversion. Add a sub-task: "Integrate `rubato` for sample rate normalization if models require fixed sample rates."
   - Consider `basic_dsp_vector` for efficient operations on audio buffers if developing custom DSP routines that require optimized vector math, due to its focus on type safety and avoiding allocations in loops.
   - Utilize lock-free ring buffers (e.g., from the `rtrb` crate) for efficient and non-blocking data transfer between audio I/O threads (e.g., `cpal` callbacks) and any separate audio processing threads. This is crucial for preventing audio glitches caused by thread contention.

2. **DSP Processing Pipeline**
   - Stem separation using Demucs algorithm (Rust integration).
   - Primary approach for Rust-based stem separation: Investigate and implement using pre-trained ONNX models (e.g., Demucs variants compatible with ONNX) via a Rust ONNX runtime like `ort` (onnxruntime-rs) or `tract`.
   - Secondary/research task for stem separation: Explore feasibility of using Rust ML frameworks like `Burn` or `Candle` for potentially running custom or re-implemented lightweight separation models in pure Rust in the future (long-term R&D).
   - MIDI extraction using pitch detection algorithms:
     - Primary candidate for Rust-based MIDI extraction: Investigate `aubio-rs` (Rust bindings for the Aubio C library) for its established pitch detection and onset detection capabilities.
     - Alternative approach: Research and prototype pure Rust pitch detection algorithms if `aubio-rs` proves unsuitable for the project's needs (e.g., due to FFI overhead, licensing, or specific feature requirements) or if minimizing FFI dependencies is a priority for this component.
   - Real-time audio effects and processing
   - For general DSP functionalities beyond what pre-trained models provide (e.g., custom filters, audio effects): Evaluate `fundsp` for building complex audio processing graphs. For simpler block-based processing or signal generation needs, consider the `dsp` crate.
   - For any direct Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) requirements (e.g., for spectral analysis, custom spectral processing, or as a component in other DSP algorithms), evaluate `rustfft` and `phastft`. Refer to available performance benchmarks (e.g., from the project's research report) when choosing.

3. **Real-time Processing and Low-Latency Design**
   - Enforce a strict pre-allocation strategy for all critical audio buffers and data structures used within the real-time audio path. Avoid any dynamic memory allocations (heap allocations) inside audio callbacks or tight processing loops. Investigate helper crates like `audio-blocks` for managing views and operations on pre-allocated audio data.
   - For complex processing chains or if significant computation is needed per audio block, design with dedicated mixer or processing threads that operate separately from the OS audio I/O threads. This helps keep the primary audio callback (e.g., from `cpal`) as lightweight and quick as possible.
   - Where the operating system allows, ensure that real-time audio processing threads are configured with elevated priority to minimize the risk of preemption by other system processes, thus reducing latency and jitter.

4. **FFI Interface Layer**
   - C-compatible API for Flutter integration
   - Serialization/deserialization of complex data types
   - Error handling and resource management

### Flutter Integration Strategy

The integration with Flutter will be implemented in phases:

1. **Phase 1: Basic Integration**
   - Simple FFI calls for audio file loading and playback
   - Synchronous processing for stem separation
   - Basic UI for controlling audio processing

2. **Phase 2: Advanced Integration**
   - Asynchronous processing with progress reporting
   - Real-time audio visualization
   - Complex data exchange (MIDI events, audio buffers)

3. **Phase 3: Full Integration**
   - Real-time audio processing with low latency
   - Seamless UI/UX for audio manipulation
   - Advanced features (time stretching, pitch shifting)

### Performance Benchmarking Framework

To ensure the new implementation meets performance targets, a comprehensive benchmarking framework will be developed:

- **Benchmarking Tools:** Utilize command-line tools such as `Hyperfine` for systematic macro-benchmarking of larger processing stages (e.g., full stem separation pipeline) and `Bencher` (or `criterion.rs`) for micro-benchmarking specific Rust functions and critical code paths to guide fine-grained optimizations.
- **Code-Level Optimization Focus:** When optimizing critical DSP code, systematically evaluate the performance implications of data structures, such as `Vec` versus fixed-size `Array`/slices, particularly within tight loops or frequently called functions. The project's research report indicates potential significant gains with fixed-size structures.
- **Profiling:** Regularly profile the Rust audio core using platform-appropriate tools (e.g., `perf` on Linux, Instruments on macOS, or other profilers) to identify performance bottlenecks ('hot spots') in the code.
- **Compilation Mode:** Always conduct performance tests and benchmarks on code compiled in release mode with optimizations enabled (i.e., using `cargo build --release` or equivalent profiles).

1. **Audio Latency Testing**
   - Round-trip latency measurement
   - Buffer size optimization
   - Platform-specific performance profiling

2. **Processing Speed Testing**
   - Stem separation processing time
   - MIDI extraction accuracy and speed
   - Memory usage and CPU utilization

3. **Quality Assessment**
   - Objective metrics (SDR, SIR, SAR)
   - Subjective listening tests
   - Comparison with existing solutions

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to enhancing the MidiStems application, focusing on performance improvements through the Rust audio core integration with the existing Flutter application.
